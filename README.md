## Description

A way to counter ground collision bug in KSP.

Bug #16159: https://bugs.kerbalspaceprogram.com/issues/16159

Sometimes KSP places a vessel a little beneath the ground and activates the physics engine. As a result the vessel is pushed out with significant force.

This mod captures the vessel before physics starts and does its best to move it just above the ground and carefully release.

As usual, drop the mod under GameData. If something goes wrong, check the config file inside the mod dir and file a bug report to *[currently N/A]*.

**BACKUP YOUR GAME BEFORE TRYING IT OUT!**
